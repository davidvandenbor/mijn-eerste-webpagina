    <h2 id="introducing">Introducing HTML</h2>
    <p id="intro">
      Before we get started learning the specifics of HTML, I want to take a
      moment to explain the importance of HTML and why it's so critical to web
      design.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3 id="importance">The Importance of HTML</h3>
      <p>
        If you've seen me talk about web design before, you've probably heard
        me say to new web designers that they need to learn at least the three
        core languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Well, those three
        languages form the backbone of all websites and web content, and
        they're critical skills for any web designer to learn. However, if you
        were ask me which of those three was the most important to learn, I'd
        say, without any hesitation, that it's HTML. Although CSS controls how
        a page looks, and JavaScript controls how it behaves, HTML provides
        the essential structure for web pages. Take away the CSS, and you
        simply have an unstyled page. Take away the JavaScript, and certain
        behaviors may cease to function. Take away the HTML however, and
        you're left with nothing at all, no web page, no content, nothing. In
        fact, to have a website, all you really need is HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        A properly written HTML document will not only be readable to the
        user, but will also convey the structure of the document, the
        relationship of its content to each other, and allow the user to link
        to other pages and sites. HTML can do all of this because it's a
        markup language. That means that HTML is used to mark up content in
        order to explain what that content is and how it relates to other
        content on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does this through the use of tags, which are used to identify
        specific types of content. A p tag, for example, identifies the
        content as a paragraph, while the nav tag would identify its content
        as being part of the page's navigation. By knowing the rules of how
        tags work together, and which tags to use, it's incredibly simple to
        author an HTML page. Sound easy? Well, that's because it is
        (chuckles). In fact, most people can learn the basics of HTML syntax
        in about five minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, for some of you, this may seem a little (chuckles) too simple. I
        mean, you're supposed to be learning how to code, right? Shouldn't
        this be a little bit more difficult? Well, I assure you, there is a
        little bit more to it than that, as you'll see in a moment. However,
        it's not an exaggeration to say that HTML is a simple language, and,
        to be honest, that is perhaps its greatest strength. You see, HTML's
        simplicity made it incredibly easy for people to learn and adopt.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early days of the web, this made it easy for developers to
        write browsers to display web content and for authors to learn how to
        structure their pages. And although HTML has grown and evolved over
        the years, it hasn't really changed that dramatically at all since the
        first version. This consistency has helped grow the adoption of the
        web, and we'll continue to feel its growth as it moves beyond browsers
        and into a connected world of devices and applications. The growth of
        connected devices like tablets, phones, appliances, and wearable tech
        are creating a much larger ecosystem for HTML content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of how complex the site or web application is, or how many
        other technologies might be involved with it, at the core of the page,
        you're going to find HTML. That's why regardless of which skills you
        choose to focus on, HTML is an essential skill for you to learn and
        master.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3 id="basic-syntax">Basic HTML Syntax</h3>
      <p>
        Earlier I stated that you could learn the basics of HTML syntax in
        about five minutes. Well, in this exercise I'm going to put that to
        the test. Now I'll be honest. It's probably going to take me a little
        bit longer than five minutes. But I think you're going to be
        pleasantly surprised at how quickly you can pick up the basics of HTML
        syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now to do this I'm going to be using the file syntax.htm. You can find
        this file in the Exercise_files > Chapter_01 > 01_02 folder. And I've
        got it opened in two places.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I've got it opened in text edit. I'm on a Mac. For this
        exercise, I'm just going to use the default text editor, which happens
        to be Text Edit. If you want to do this along with me, if you're on
        Windows, open it up in, say, Notepad. Or you could use a different
        program like TextWrangler. You just want to make sure you're using a
        basic text editor that can handle raw TXT files. The reason I'm using
        this and not some code editor. Is I want to reinforce the concept that
        HTML is really nothing other than a TXT file. There's no special
        encoding going on with it. It's simply a TXT file with a .htm or .html
        extension. That's all it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now on the right hand side, I had the same file opened up in a
        browser. In this case, Google Chrome. So, when I make an edit to the
        file, I can come over here and refresh the page. And you can see what
        that edit does to it as far as rendering in the browser gets.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let's talk about the basics of HTML syntax. Now, remember that HTML
        stands for hypertext markup language. That means that we use tags to
        mark up content on the page to identify it. You can see this text, for
        example as a paragraph. Well, it's not a paragraph yet, and in order
        to make it one, we're going to have to mark it up using a paragraph
        tag. So, to do that I'm going to go right over here to the very front
        of the document and I'm just going to open up a paragraph tag. To do
        that I'm going to use a left angle bracket. Followed by the character
        that represents the element I want, P for paragraph. And then, close
        the opening tag with a right angle bracket. So, that is the makeup, or
        the syntax if you will, of an opening tag. You've got the left angle
        bracket, you've got the character, or characters, that represent that
        particular element. In this case, P for paragraph, and then, the right
        angle bracket. Now everything a browser's basically going to look at
        this. And it's going to know that everything after this is contained
        within that paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most elements are going to have both an opening and a closing tag.
        When your browser or user agent is looking at this, it says okay, this
        is the beginning of a paragraph. But you also need to tell it where
        the paragraph ends. So in this case I'm going to go to the very end of
        the paragraph and I'm going to do what's known as a closing tag. Now
        closing tags look almost exactly the same so I'm going to open it
        using a left-angle bracket. But then I'm going to do a forward slash
        followed by the P followed by the right-angle bracket. So they're
        almost exactly the same. The only difference. From the opening and
        closing tag is that forward slash. And it always precedes the
        character that it identifies. So essentially we have an opening
        paragraph tag right here. We have a closing paragraph tag. And then we
        have the contents of the tag right in the middle. And then the entire
        thing is considered a paragraph element.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when you hear HTML referred to as elements. Basically, elements
        refer to the tags and their contents, whereas this is simply the tag
        itself. But in addition to the tags, each of the tags can also have
        certain attributes. Some attributes are specific to the elements,
        whereas other attributes are what we call global attributes. Now the
        paragraph tag doesn't really have. Any specific attributes to it, but
        it does have some global ones that we could apply. If I wanted to
        apply an attribute to the paragraph tag, I would go under the opening
        tag, and right after the character, I would open up a space. And then
        I would type in the attribute that I wanted. Paragraphs don't have
        that many, so let's just pick language. So I'm going to type in
        L-A-N-G. So of course you'll have to learn the attributes themselves.
        Then you type in an equals to assign a value to it, and then in
        quotation marks you give it a value. In this case I'm going to say en
        for english. So here I'm telling the user agent that the contents of
        this paragraph are in english. Now, don't panic. You don't have to do
        this for every element. It's just kind of a nice thing to do if this
        paragraph had Spanish in it. I could say language equals Spanish, and
        then spell checkers would know. To either check it using a Spanish
        dictionary or ignore it for English spellings. What we're looking at
        is the syntax of the attributes. So you have the name of the
        attribute. Then you have an equals sign, which is basically an
        assignment operator. And then you have the value. And the value's
        always going to be contained within quotation marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there is basically two types of attributes. There is informative,
        which is this in giving extra information about the element and there
        is functional. So, for something like a link which is done using an
        anchor element. There is a attribute called href. And the href
        attribute tell the browser were to go when the link is clicked. So,
        some attributes are really important and functional. Whereas other
        attributes are merely just giving the browser or user agent a little
        bit more information about that element. I don't need this attribute,
        so I'm going to get rid of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now just to kind of show you that what we're doing does make a
        difference, I'm going to save this and if I go over to my browser and
        refresh this. Nothing really happens. The reason for that is that
        paragraphs are kind of the default elements in HTML. If a browser sees
        text that's outside of an element. It's going to assume that you
        wanted that to be a paragraph, and it's going to render it like that.
        So if you want to actually see your tag making a difference, then
        we're just going to change it. So if I come over here, and change
        paragraph to h1. And I have to do that both for the opening and
        closing tags. H1 stands for heading one. That's a top level heading.
        So now I have an opening and a closing h1 tag instead of a p tag. If I
        save this. Go back to my browser and refresh. Now we see a difference,
        because the browser is saying, oh. That's a heading one, and so you
        get its default H1 rendering, which is sort of big and bold. So I'm
        going to go ahead and get rid of that and just change this back to a
        paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        So at this point, we've talked a little bit about how we can identify
        content on the page. Simply by using the tag that represents the type
        of content we want to display. Easy enough. Now, HTML syntax also
        allows us to create more complicated structures by nesting one element
        inside of another one. So let's say within this paragraph that we had
        some text that we wanted to emphasize, for example, this last
        sentence. Well, if in front of the second sentence here I added an
        emphasis tag, or em,. If I started an instance tag, I could close that
        before the closing paragraph tag. And then what I've done, is I've
        emphasized this last sentence. Now, this is called nesting, and
        essentially, it makes the paragraph tag a parent tag, and it makes the
        emphasis element a child element. So we have parent elements, and we
        have child elements. And we can nest them together to create these
        more complex structures. If I save this and test it you can see that
        the last sentence is now italicised which is being emphasized. Now
        there are rules around this nesting. Certain tags for example can't
        nest inside of other tags and that's just one of those thing you have
        to learn. The other thing that you have to learn is the syntaxual rule
        that if you open a child element the child element has to close before
        its parent element. For example, let's take this word paragraph maybe
        I want it to strongly emphasize that text. So in front of paragraph if
        I gave it a strong tag. And you can see that the characters that are
        used to identify the tags are not always single characters. In fact
        it's very rare that they are single characters. In this case strong
        for a strong tag. Well if I wanted to close that I couldn't come out
        here. And close the strong tag. This wouldn't work. But this would be
        invalid code. So essentially, if I wanted to close the strong tag.
        Because the strong tag was inside the emphasis tag, and also inside
        the paragraph tag. It would have to close before the emphasis tag. So
        I would need to move this right here. In order to have proper syntax.
        So now my strong tag is closing fist, followed by the em-tag, followed
        by the paragraph tag. And if I save this and refresh my browser you
        can see that that's rendered within the browser itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so those are the basics of HTML syntax, and it took us a little
        longer than five minutes, but not too much longer. So, just remember,
        content in HTML is identified by wrapping it in an HTML tag. You can
        also further enhance those usually with attributes. That can either
        tell you more about the element, or it can provide additional
        functionality for you. So from this point forward, it's really just a
        matter of learning the different HTML tags. When it's appropriate to
        nest them, and which tags you can nest inside of one another. And then
        the attributes that you can use with each of them.
